This repository contains all the code files, simulation resources, and the final project report for our Mobile Robotics project. It includes source code for controllers, planners, and CBF-based collision avoidance, along with complete Gazebo simulation files and launch files organized clearly by their content. The project is designed to run in a Linux environment with Gazebo Harmonic and ROS 2 Jazzy already installed. Once the environment is set up, the simulation can be launched directly using the provided files. The repository also includes the final report detailing the methodology, experiments, and results of the project. For any questions or issues, users can open an Issue on GitHub.
