Mobile Robotics Project

This repository contains all the code files, simulation resources, and the final project report for our Mobile Robotics project.

Project Contents

Source code for controllers, planners, and CBF-based collision avoidance

Gazebo simulation files

Launch files for running the full robot simulation

Final report documenting methodology, experiments, and results

All files are clearly named according to their purpose for easy navigation.

Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, use a Linux environment with Gazebo and ROS 2.
Once your environment is ready, you can directly launch the simulation using the provided files.
